        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello,  My name is Oranee Kasem, a student learning Software
          development.<br />

          A little bit about me — I was born in Thailand but moved to
          Wellington, New Zealand about six years ago. <br />
          Growing up in Thailand taught me the importance of respect, growth,
          and, most importantly, kindness.<br />
          I consider myself a hardworking person who is always looking to learn
          new skills, gain knowledge, <br />and explore new opportunities to
          create a better future for myself and my family.
          <br />
          I worked as a barista and café manager for three years, but I have
          always wanted to pursue a new career <br />that offers more stability
          and balance.
          <br />
          After completing my first Information Technology course with an A+
          grade, I knew this was the path I wanted to.<br />Learning in this
          field was not easy, especially as English is my second language,<br />
          but I'm proud of the progress I have made so far<br />
          During that course, I also learned a bit about making simple websites,
          which sparked my interest even more.<br />
          Surprisingly, I did not like computer gaming before I got into I.T. —
          instead, I have always been more passionate about food and travel.
          After doing thorough research, I decided to join a Software
          Development course.<br />
          I am highly motivated to learn as much as I can through this program,
          and I truly hope it will be the beginning of an exciting new career
          for me.<br />
          <br />
