        <h2>Story of Te Houtaewa</h2>
        <p>
          A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.
        </p>
        <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
        <p>
          Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks
          on his peoples enemies. <br />
          One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and
          asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance
          away.<br />
          He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the
          hangi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for
          Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived
          there.<br />
          Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind,
          completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety
          Mile Beach)<br />
          in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On
          reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka
          (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill
          Whangatauatia.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
          stealing the kai (food). <br />
          He was immediately recognised.
