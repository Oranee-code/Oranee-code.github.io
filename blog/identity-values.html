        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          One important decision I made was to leave my job so I could study
          full-time. It was hard because I didn’t have much support, but I
          really wanted to change my life and do something I enjoy. I had to
          choose between staying in a safe job or following what I want.<br />
          Now, when I look back, I feel it was the right decision and I’m proud
          of it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My culture and the people around me taught me to be respectful,
          patient, and to always work hard. I’ve seen people do their best with
          very little,<br />
          and that made me grateful and motivated to always learn and improve.
          My values come from my family and community to be kind, humble, and
          never give up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My biggest strength is curiosity. I always want to learn new things
          and understand how they work. I also don’t give up easily. <br />
          These strengths help me stay motivated, even when things are hard.
          They will support me through my study and in my future career.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my limitations is communication. I feel shy when I speak in a
          group, and I worry people won’t understand me, especially in
          English.<br />
          Also, sometimes I learn a bit slower, but I always get there in the
          end. I know this about myself, so I try to stay patient and keep
          improving.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p>
          At a past job, I worked with someone who didn’t want to cooperate with
          the team. It made things harder for everyone. I stayed calm and
          focused on my own work. That helped a little, but it didn’t fix the
          problem. I was just trying to let it go, but I should have done
          better.<br />
          Now, I think I could have talked to them in a kind and respectful way
          or asked a team leader for help. <br />
          I’ve learned that good communication is better than staying quiet or
          avoiding the problem.
