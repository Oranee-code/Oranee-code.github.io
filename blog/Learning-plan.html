        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <p>
          My goal is to land a job in front-end, back-end, or software
          engineering and keep growing in this career. I've already started this
          journey by studying in this field. <br />
          One of my strengths is curiosity I love learning new things and
          exploring how things work.It keeps me motivated, helps me ask
          questions, and pushes me to keep growing and improving in everything I
          do, especially in tech and coding. I don’t give up easily, I push
          myself and always try to prove that I can do it.<br />
          My limitation is communication. In group meetings or when I have to
          speak out loud, I often feel shy and not very confident. I sometimes
          worry that others might not understand me, especially because English
          is not my first language. But I’m working on building my confidence
          and improving my communication step by step.br>
          <br />
          During this program I want to build more confidence, especially when
          it comes to job interviews, networking, and communication in a
          professional environment.<br />
          I sometimes feel shy or unsure when speaking in groups or meeting new
          people, so I want to get more comfortable with that, so I can work
          well with others and grow both personally and professionally. These
          skills will help me feel more ready and confident. <br />
          <br />

          How I will work productively and safely with others: First, I need to
          take care of myself. I’ll take breaks when I need to, and speak up if
          I’m feeling overwhelmed or need help and respect others and help
          create a safe and inclusive space for everyone.<br />
          Stay organised, manage my time well, and come prepared to meetings and
          group work. I’ll also be open to feedback and always try to
          improve.<br />
          <br />
          What I will do when things start to build up: I’ll pause and check in
          with myself. If I feel stressed, Take a break, step away from the
          screen, and clear my head. <br />
          and remind myself to be kind to myself not everything goes to plan,
          and that’s okay. Struggles help us grow, and sometimes the problem
          just needs a fresh mind (or a snack!). I’ll break things down into
          smaller tasks and focus on one thing at at a time. <br />
          And if I still need help, talk to someone sometimes just saying it out
          loud makes a big difference. <br />
          <br />
          I’m always open to feedback and I see asking for help as a way to
          grow. if I’m stuck I’ll reach out to facilitators, classmates, or look
          for online resources. I’ll be honest with myself about what I’m
          struggling with and remember that I don’t have to do this alone —
          learning is a shared journey.<br />
          I don’t expect anything specific because I believe the Facilitation
          team knows their role well. But I do hope for flexibility and
          understanding, because everyone learns differently. For example, I
          chose to study online because I know I work better on my own with a
          flexible but responsible routine. I also tend to focus better and
          study faster at night.<br />
          <br />
          I’m currently studying full-time and do not have a part-time job or
          other big commitments. This means I’m fully available and focused on
          my learning during the course. I’ll manage my time well, take breaks
          when needed, and make sure to keep a healthy balance between study and
          rest. If anything changes or I have new commitments, I’ll communicate
          that early.
